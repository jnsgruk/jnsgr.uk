I'm a technical leader and software engineer working for [Canonical](https://canonical.com) as VP
Engineering.

At work my primary focus is leading the development of [Juju](https://juju.is) and the ecosystem of
[charms](https://charmhub.io), but my activities extend into leadership development and product
strategy.

In my own time, I'm a keen open source software advocate with long history of tinkering with the
Linux desktop. I'm an insufferable petrolhead and a self-professed connoisseur of mountain bikes,
coffee, cocktails and Mexican food.

I live with my wife and son in Bristol, UK.
