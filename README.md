# jnsgr.uk

This repository contains the code for my personal website https://jnsgr.uk.

The site is a simple business-card style site built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and served
with [gosherve](https://github.com/jnsgruk/gosherve), which is a tiny little Go webserver that I
wrote for serving this page, as well as some static URL redirects from a Github gist.

The site is hosted on a free instance at [Fly.io](https://fly.io), and deployed automatically with
Github Actions.
