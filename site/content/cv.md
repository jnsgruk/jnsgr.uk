I'm an inspiring, motivated technical leader with excellent communication skills capable of
building high-performing teams. I'm a true technologist with an energetic passion for open-source,
security and the professional development of those around me.

My focus is on technical leadership, but I'm a skilled software engineer that's not afraid to get
my hands dirty. My primary area of technical expertise is in Cloud automation, Linux and
Information Security.

I'm heavily motivated by hard technical problems for good causes.

## Experience

My technical reach extends beyond my own projects as a trusted advisor to those my junior and
senior. I'm frequently involved in engineering decisions behind Ubuntu, LXD, MAAS, Multipass and
Canonical Kubernetes.

My day-to-day focus is on the development of the directors, managers and senior ICs in my

the board.
